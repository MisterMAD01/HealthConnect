# **App Name**: HealthConnect

## Core Features:

- User Authentication: Secure user authentication with Firebase Authentication, supporting Patient, Doctor, and Hospital Admin roles.
- Role-Based Access: Role-based access control to features and data, implemented using Firebase Security Rules.
- Appointment Booking: Allow patients to find and book appointments with doctors, integrated with Cloud Firestore.
- EHR Management: Enable doctors to view and edit patient Electronic Health Records (EHR) using forms connected to Cloud Firestore.
- Medication Reminders: Schedule and send medication reminders via push notifications using Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM) managed by Cloud Functions.
- AI Service Integration (Mock): Include a placeholder Cloud Function to demonstrate integration with an external AI service for future enhancements. This function will accept requests and send data to a mock AI service. A tool, in production, would potentially enhance diagnostics or suggest treatment options based on data submitted to the tool.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Light blue (#ADD8E6) for a calming, trustworthy feel associated with health and wellness.

- Body and headline font: 'PT Sans', a humanist sans-serif font that provides a modern look, and some warmth to give some personality.
- Use consistent and clear icons for navigation and data representation to enhance usability.
- Implement a responsive layout to ensure the application is accessible on various devices (desktops, tablets, and mobile phones).
- Incorporate subtle animations and transitions to provide feedback to user interactions.
